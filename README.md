## C++ libCURL

This application builds on another application that I wrote that uses libCURL -- you can find the project [source code here](https://github.com/brian-chau/cpp_curl).

With this version, instead of downloading HTML, I download the files located at the URLs.

In this version, I plan to parse the HTML that lists the files to download like a web scraper, and then download the files listed at the URLs.
