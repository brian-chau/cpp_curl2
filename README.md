## C++ libCURL

This application builds on another application that I wrote that uses libCURL -- you can find the project [source code here](https://github.com/brian-chau/cpp_curl).

With this version, I scrape the website for the URL and an associated chapter number, so that the files will be named in order that they are downloaded.
